# OpenGL_3D_Scene

//How do I approach designing software?
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project has greatly delevoped my 3D rendering. I learned how to create a handful of simple 2D and 3D shapes, as well as how to apply colorful textiles to them and how to create a light source and the reflection of light off of objects. 
  
  What design process did you follow for your project work?
We followed programming best practices in organizing code, naming norms, and adding comments to help explain the code. First we picked out a picture we wanted to replicate in 3D. Then we brainstormed how we will go about doing that in a concept paper. Then bit by bit we added each element to the scene with multiple iterations of adding, running, and tweaking the code to get the final product. 
  
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
No matter what the project is, it is going to require a decition of what the goal is, brain storming how to accomplish the goal, and an iterative process to complete the goal. All of which I was able to practice in this project. 

//How do I approach developing programs?
  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
While working on a program, I tend to have a bad practice of building too much at a time before stopping to test the product. In this project however, I was able to practice implementing little bits at a time. Also, instead of googling the problems I ran into, I was able to use the resources provided to solve most problems and reaching out to my teacher solved the rest of them. 
  
  How did iteration factor into your development?
You can't go for perfection in your first render, especially if it is a complex scene. You add one item, position it where you want, add color/texture, and then when all that looks decent you move on to the next item. Once that is all in place you might want to add some lighting and additional camera movement and that will take multiple renders to get just right. There is lots of iteration necessary when working with code and also with graphics. 

  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
As already mentioned, this project as really helped me develop a slower, iterative process to my coding. If I tried to build too much at a time, I would have no idea where to even start looking for the problem. If I threw out five new items and only two of them are showing up, is one of the items causing a problem with another one rendering or did I miss something in the render code of that object... and the list goes on. It is best to slow down and take it one step at a time. 
  
//How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational/professional pathway?
As a computer science major, getting my feet wet in lots of different areas like comp graphics will help greatly in my future endevores. Even if I never do anymore 3D programming like we learned here, I still practiced valuable skills in patient programming and learning new concepts.
