# OpenGL_3D_Scene

How do I approach designing software?
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project has greatly delevoped my 3D rendering. I learned how to create a handful of simple 2D and 3D shapes, as well as how to apply colorful textiles to them and how to create a light source and the reflection of light off of objects. 
  
  What design process did you follow for your project work?
We followed programming best practices in organizing code, naming norms, and adding comments to help explain the code. 
  
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
How do I approach developing programs?
  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  How did iteration factor into your development?
  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
